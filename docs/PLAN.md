# Midnight Kicks — Penalty Shootout on Midnight

**Target:** FIFA World Cup 2026 (June 11 - July 19)
**Updated:** 2026-04-28

## Concept

PvP penalty shootout on Android. Two players, five rounds, real stakes (PREPROD NIGHT). Unity 3D + Midnight ZK proofs. The contract is the referee — no server, no trust.

**Why:** World Cup timing. Trojan horse for ZK (players don't know they're using zero-knowledge proofs). SDK validation before Kuira ships. Open-source connector SDK as the "Build on Midnight" story.

## Game flow

1. **CHOICE** — both players pick 5 directions simultaneously, submit ONE transaction each (batch commit)
2. **PROVE** — one ZK circuit compares all 5 rounds at once, single proof
3. **REPLAY** — Unity plays the full match cinematically (stadium intro masks proof latency)

Sudden death: batches of 5, circuit stops at decisive round. Unrevealed rounds stay private (ZK property).

**Anti-cheat:** commit-reveal. Hash of 5 choices + nonces stored as private state. ZK circuit proves revealed choices match commitments. Cannot change choices after commit.

Detailed game logic, state machine, circuit specs, UI flows, and Unity bridge spec in [`GAME_DESIGN.md`](GAME_DESIGN.md). Current Unity work and asset checklist in [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

## Stakes & gas

- PREPROD NIGHT stakes (configurable per match, default 1 NIGHT). Winner takes pot, draw = refund.
- DUST for gas via PREPROD faucet. Provider-pay model on mainnet (developer subsidizes gas).

## Timeout & disconnect

- Commitment timeout (5 min) — if opponent doesn't commit, committed player claims pot (forfeit).
- Replay is client-side (Unity) — disconnect mid-replay doesn't affect on-chain result.
- Match cancellation if opponent never joins (reclaim stake after timeout).

## Matchmaking

- **QR (in-person):** Create Match → show QR → opponent scans → joined.
- **Deep link (remote):** Create Match → share `midnight://kicks?match=<contract_address>` → opponent opens.
- Match ID = deployed contract address. No central server.

## Leaderboard

On-chain, indexer-queryable. Wins/losses/draws/streaks per player address. Verifiable — no fake leaderboards.

## Architecture

- **Unity (UaaL)** — 3D stadium, ball physics, choice UI, cinematic replay. JSON bridge to Kotlin. Knows nothing about blockchain.
- **Kotlin (native)** — SDK for contract interaction, pairing (QR + deep links), UaaL bridge, state polling for opponent commits.
- **Compact contract** — match lifecycle, commit-reveal, scoring, stake escrow, payouts. Each match = new contract instance.
  - Private state: 5 choices + nonces per player
  - Public ledger: participants, scores, results, winner, stakes, phase
  - Circuits: create, join, commit batch, resolve regulation, resolve sudden death, claim payout

## Repo & relationship to Kuira

Separate repo: `midnight-kicks/` (app/ + unity/ + contract/). Consumes Kuira SDK as pre-built AAR. Proves the SDK works standalone — if Kicks can't build without the full Kuira repo, the SDK isn't self-contained. Connector SDK open-sourced separately.

## Identity (two-tier) — INVESTIGATED, DECIDED

- **Tier 1 (standalone):** SDK generates keys (Android Keystore), manages UTXOs, signs/submits. No external wallet.
- **Tier 2 (Kuira enhanced):** SDK detects Kuira → delegates to TEE-backed sigil. Automatic upgrade, no code change.

| Primitive | Decision | Tier 1 (SDK) | Tier 2 (Kuira) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Passkey (P-256) | CredentialManager (API 28+) | Google Password Manager | TEE/StrongBox + biometric |
| DID | `did:key` from root passkey | One per user (not per-dApp) | Sigil dashboard |
| Access key | secp256k1 (advocate P-256 to Midnight) | Self-verifiable keyAuthorization | Delegation policies |
| Recovery | PRF-encrypted cloud backup | Zero words, passkey syncs | TEE-hardened key material |

**Our edge over rvcas:** self-verifiable keyAuthorization (TEE signs directly, no server trust). Full investigation in the parent Kuira repo at `kuira-android-wallet/docs/planning/IDENTITY_INVESTIGATION.md` (not copied here — it spans both Kicks and Kuira).

## SDK friction log

Every friction point building BBoard standalone → becomes SDK improvement.

| # | Friction | Severity | Fix |
|---|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Fee fallback to INITIAL_PARAMETERS → 66T specks → imbalanced tx → error 170 | Critical | Zero-fee detection. Need convergence loop for mainnet. |
| 2 | DustLocalState serialize/deserialize corrupts Merkle roots | High | In-memory only workaround. Needs SCALE codec fix. |
| 3 | Full dust sync 60s on PREPROD (253k events) | Medium | Background sync + progress bar. Optimize later. |
| 4 | `fromId: null` skips early events (indexer treats null ≠ 0) | Critical | Always pass `id: 0`. |
| 5 | Tag-prefix hex splitting corrupts events at scale | Critical | Line-per-event file format. |
| 6 | No progress during balance+submit (60s opaque) | High | BalanceProgress callbacks (6 stages). |
| 7 | FFI pointer write-back corrupts cached state | High | Don't write back post-spend state. |
| 8 | WebSocket backpressure OOM on 250k events | Medium | File streaming, Rust native memory. |
| 9 | No contract deployment API | Medium | ✅ FIXED. `MidnightContract.deploy()` + FFI. |
| 10 | Content behind system status bar | Low | WindowInsets padding. |

## Decision log

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Batch vs per-round | Batch (5 choices, 1 tx) | 2 txs per match vs 20. Cinematic replay. |
| Sudden death | Batches of 5, stop at decisive | Unrevealed rounds private. No infinite loops. |
| Unity vs Compose | Unity (UaaL) | 3D stadium, ball physics, cameras. |
| Standalone repo | Separate from Kuira | Tests SDK boundaries. Separate release. |
| Pairing | QR + deep links (built in Kicks) | Simpler than connector transports. |
| Key curve | secp256k1 (advocate P-256) | Midnight accepts secp256k1 today. |
| keyAuthorization | Self-verifiable (TEE signs) | No server trust needed. |
| DID | One per user from root passkey | Sigil = one identity. |
| Recovery | PRF-encrypted cloud backup | Zero words. Passkey syncs → biometric → restored. |
| Gas | PREPROD faucet (provider-pay on mainnet) | Lowest friction for testnet. |
| Proving | On-device (local) | Proves hardware capability. No server. |
