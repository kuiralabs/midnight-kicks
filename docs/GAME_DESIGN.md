### Phases (from contract)

| Phase | Description | Transitions to |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `WAITING` | P1 created match + escrowed stake. Waiting for P2. | → `COMMITTING` (P2 joins) or `COMPLETE` (timeout) |
| `COMMITTING` | Both players submit batch commitments (hash of 5 choices + nonce). | → `REVEALING` (both committed) or `COMPLETE` (timeout forfeit) |
| `REVEALING` | Both players reveal preimages. Circuit verifies against commitments. | → `COMPLETE` (clear winner) or `SD_COMMITTING` (tied) |
| `SD_COMMITTING` | Sudden death: both commit a new batch of 5. | → `SD_REVEALING` (both committed) or `COMPLETE` (timeout forfeit) |
| `SD_REVEALING` | Both reveal SD choices. Circuit resolves round-by-round, stops at decisive. | → `COMPLETE` (winner found) or `SD_COMMITTING` (still tied) |
| `COMPLETE` | Match over. Winner claims payout, or draw refund. | Terminal |

### Timeout rules

- Each phase has a `deadline` (unix seconds). Default: 5 minutes.
- If deadline passes with only one player having acted → that player can call `claimTimeout()` to win by forfeit.
- WAITING phase: P1 can cancel and reclaim stake if P2 never joins.

---

## 2. Batch commit-reveal protocol

### Direction encoding

| Value | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | LEFT |
| 1 | CENTER |
| 2 | RIGHT |

Any value > 2 is rejected by `validDirection()` check in circuit.

### Commitment

```
commitment = persistentCommit(BatchPreimage { c0, c1, c2, c3, c4 }, nonce)
```

- `BatchPreimage`: struct of 5 `Uint<8>` direction choices
- `nonce`: 32-byte random (prevents rainbow table attacks on 3^5 = 243 possibilities)
- `persistentCommit`: Midnight's native Pedersen commitment (binding + hiding)

### Reveal

Player reveals all 5 choices + nonce. Circuit recomputes commitment and verifies it matches the stored hash. If mismatch → transaction fails (cheating detected).

### Scoring (regulation)

Each round: if shooter direction ≠ keeper direction → GOAL, else → SAVE.
Roles alternate: odd rounds P1 shoots, even rounds P2 shoots.

```
Round 1: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c0 vs p2c0
Round 2: P2 shoots, P1 keeps → compare p2c1 vs p1c1
Round 3: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c2 vs p2c2
Round 4: P2 shoots, P1 keeps → compare p2c3 vs p1c3
Round 5: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c4 vs p2c4
```

If `shooter_dir != keeper_dir` → scorer gets +1.

### Scoring (sudden death)

Same batch format, same commit-reveal. But resolution stops at the first decisive round:

```
for each round i (0..4):
  P1 shoots: p1_scores = (p1c[i] != p2c[i])
  P2 shoots: p2_scores = (p2c[i] != p1c[i])
  if only one scored → that player wins (decisive)
  if both scored or both missed → continue
```

**ZK property:** rounds after the decisive one are never disclosed. The circuit only reveals results up to and including the decisive round.

If all 5 SD rounds are non-decisive → back to `SD_COMMITTING` for another batch.

## 3. Contract circuits

| Circuit | When | Inputs (public) | Witnesses (private) | Effects |
|---------|------|-----------------|--------------------|---------| 
| `constructor` | Deploy | — | — | Set phase=WAITING, P1=caller, deadline=now+1hr |
| `joinMatch` | P2 joins | — | secretKey | Set P2, escrow stake, phase→COMMITTING, deadline=now+5min |
| `commitBatch` | Each player | — | 5 choices + nonce | Store commitment hash, set committed flag |
| `revealBatch` | Each player | — | 5 choices + nonce | Verify vs commitment, store revealed choices |
| `resolveRegulation` | After both reveal | — | — | Score 5 rounds, set winner or phase→SD_COMMITTING |
| `sdCommitBatch` | SD commit | — | 5 choices + nonce | Same as commitBatch for SD |
| `sdRevealAndResolve` | SD reveal | — | 5 choices + nonce | Verify, score round-by-round, stop at decisive |
| `claimTimeout` | Deadline passed | — | — | Forfeit opponent, payout to caller |
| `claimPayout` | COMPLETE phase | — | secretKey | Transfer stake to winner |

## 4. Screen flow (IA)

```
[Splash] → [Home]
              │
              ├─ Create Match → [Waiting for Opponent] → [Choice Phase]
              │                   (shows QR + share link)
              │
              ├─ Join Match → [Choice Phase]
              │   (scan QR or deep link)
              │
              └─ Leaderboard → [Rankings]

[Choice Phase]
  Pick 5 directions (L/C/R per round)
  "Lock in" → commit tx → [Waiting for Opponent]

[Waiting for Opponent]
  Opponent committed? → [Stadium Intro]
  Timeout? → [Forfeit Win]

[Stadium Intro]
  Flyover + crowd buildup (masks proof + reveal tx time)
  Prove + reveal in background
  Both revealed? → [Match Replay]

[Match Replay]
  Unity cinematic: 5 rounds played sequentially
  Each round: ball flight → GOAL! or SAVE!
  Running score overlay
  After round 5:
    Clear winner → [Result Screen]
    Tied → [Sudden Death Choice Phase]

[Sudden Death Choice Phase]
  Same as Choice Phase but labeled "SUDDEN DEATH"
  After reveal → replay only decisive rounds

[Result Screen]
  Winner announcement + final score
  "Claim winnings" → payout tx
  "Play again" → back to Home

[Forfeit Win]
  "Opponent didn't respond"
  "Claim winnings" → payout tx
```

### State polling

While waiting for opponent actions, the Kotlin layer polls the contract state via the indexer subscription. When the opponent's committed/revealed flags change → transition to next screen.

## 5. Unity ↔ Kotlin bridge

UaaL renders Unity full-screen as an Android Activity. Communication via `UnitySendMessage` (Kotlin → Unity) and `AndroidJavaObject` callbacks (Unity → Kotlin).

### Kotlin → Unity messages

```json
// Start choice phase
{ "type": "choicePhase", "round": "regulation", "playerRole": "shooter" }

// Start replay with results

  ],

```

### Unity → Kotlin messages

```json

  "choices": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]
}

## 6. Edge cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Both players pick identical directions all 5 rounds | Score 0-0 → sudden death |
| Both miss all 5 in sudden death | Non-decisive → another SD batch |
| Player commits then closes app | Timeout → opponent claims forfeit |
| Both players timeout (neither commits) | Both can reclaim their stake |
| Player tries to reveal wrong preimage | Circuit rejects (commitment mismatch) |
| Player submits invalid direction (>2) | `validDirection()` check fails in circuit |
| Network disconnect during replay | On-chain result unchanged, replay is cosmetic |
| Player opens app after match resolved | Sees result screen, can claim payout |
| 10+ sudden death batches (extreme tie) | Protocol supports infinite batches. Practically impossible (3^5 = 243 combinations). |
