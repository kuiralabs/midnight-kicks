### Phases (from contract)

| Phase | Description | Transitions to |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `WAITING` | P1 created match + escrowed stake. Waiting for P2. | → `COMMITTING` (P2 joins) or `COMPLETE` (timeout) |
| `COMMITTING` | Both players submit batch commitments (hash of 5 choices + nonce). | → `REVEALING` (both committed) or `COMPLETE` (timeout forfeit) |
| `REVEALING` | Both players reveal preimages. Circuit verifies against commitments. | → `COMPLETE` (clear winner) or `SD_COMMITTING` (tied) |
| `SD_COMMITTING` | Sudden death: both commit a new batch of 5. | → `SD_REVEALING` (both committed) or `COMPLETE` (timeout forfeit) |
| `SD_REVEALING` | Both reveal SD choices. Circuit resolves round-by-round, stops at decisive. | → `COMPLETE` (winner found) or `SD_COMMITTING` (still tied) |
| `COMPLETE` | Match over. Winner claims payout, or draw refund. | Terminal |

### Timeout rules

- Each phase has a `deadline` (unix seconds). Default: 5 minutes.
- If deadline passes with only one player having acted → that player can call `claimTimeout()` to win by forfeit.
- WAITING phase: P1 can cancel and reclaim stake if P2 never joins.

---

## 2. Batch commit-reveal protocol

### Direction encoding

| Value | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | LEFT |
| 1 | CENTER |
| 2 | RIGHT |

Any value > 2 is rejected by `validDirection()` check in circuit.

### Coordinate convention

**Directions are always from the SHOOTER's perspective.** Reference:
`unity/Assets/Keeper.cs:105` — the `direction` arg into `Keeper.Dive`
expects `0=left, 2=right` "from the shooter's perspective." The keeper
faces the shooter (mirrored), so `Dive(0)` plays `DiveRight` animation
even though the direction value is "left" — same physical spot, just
opposite-handed body lean.

This matters for the choice UI: when a keeper taps LEFT during the
commit phase, the underlying value committed is `0` (shooter's left),
not "the keeper's left." Without explicit framing, this is confusing —
see §4 *Per-role choice UI* for the open design question and ticket.

### Shoot-vs-keep role per round

The contract alternates shooter/keeper roles by index: `i % 2 == 0` → P1
shoots, otherwise P2 shoots. In a 5-round batch P1 shoots 3 times
(rounds 1, 3, 5), P2 shoots 2 times (rounds 2, 4). Sudden death uses
the same alternation per batch.

**Each player commits ONE direction per round** — the same committed
value is interpreted as the shoot direction or the dive direction
depending on whose turn it is to shoot. Players don't commit separate
"offense" and "defense" arrays.

### Commitment

```
commitment = persistentCommit(BatchPreimage { c0, c1, c2, c3, c4 }, nonce)
```

- `BatchPreimage`: struct of 5 `Uint<8>` direction choices
- `nonce`: 32-byte random (prevents rainbow table attacks on 3^5 = 243 possibilities)
- `persistentCommit`: Midnight's native Pedersen commitment (binding + hiding)

### Reveal

Player reveals all 5 choices + nonce. Circuit recomputes commitment and verifies it matches the stored hash. If mismatch → transaction fails (cheating detected).

### Scoring (regulation)

Each round: if shooter direction ≠ keeper direction → GOAL, else → SAVE.
Roles alternate: odd rounds P1 shoots, even rounds P2 shoots.

```
Round 1: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c0 vs p2c0
Round 2: P2 shoots, P1 keeps → compare p2c1 vs p1c1
Round 3: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c2 vs p2c2
Round 4: P2 shoots, P1 keeps → compare p2c3 vs p1c3
Round 5: P1 shoots, P2 keeps → compare p1c4 vs p2c4
```

If `shooter_dir != keeper_dir` → scorer gets +1.

### Scoring (sudden death)

Same batch format, same commit-reveal. But resolution stops at the first decisive round:

```
for each round i (0..4):
  P1 shoots: p1_scores = (p1c[i] != p2c[i])
  P2 shoots: p2_scores = (p2c[i] != p1c[i])
  if only one scored → that player wins (decisive)
  if both scored or both missed → continue
```

**ZK property:** rounds after the decisive one are never disclosed. The circuit only reveals results up to and including the decisive round.

If all 5 SD rounds are non-decisive → back to `SD_COMMITTING` for another batch.

---

## 3. Contract circuits

| Circuit | When | Inputs (public) | Witnesses (private) | Effects |
|---------|------|-----------------|--------------------|---------| 
| `constructor` | Deploy | — | — | Set phase=WAITING, P1=caller, deadline=now+1hr |
| `joinMatch` | P2 joins | — | secretKey | Set P2, escrow stake, phase→COMMITTING, deadline=now+5min |
| `commitBatch` | Each player | — | 5 choices + nonce | Store commitment hash, set committed flag |
| `revealBatch` | Each player | — | 5 choices + nonce | Verify vs commitment, store revealed choices |
| `resolveRegulation` | After both reveal | — | — | Score 5 rounds, set winner or phase→SD_COMMITTING |
| `sdCommitBatch` | SD commit | — | 5 choices + nonce | Same as commitBatch for SD |
| `sdRevealAndResolve` | SD reveal | — | 5 choices + nonce | Verify, score round-by-round, stop at decisive |
| `claimTimeout` | Deadline passed | — | — | Forfeit opponent, payout to caller |
| `claimPayout` | COMPLETE phase | — | secretKey | Transfer stake to winner |

---

## 4. Screen flow (IA)

State-based navigation via `KicksScreen` (sealed class in
`app/.../KicksScreen.kt`). No `Navigation-Compose` dep; `KicksActivity`
holds a `mutableStateOf<KicksScreen>` and renders the matching
Composable.

                                                       await P1 reveal, reveal

On result:
  • sessionStore.clear() if PvP (RESUME MATCH disappears from menu)
  • UnityBridge.sendReplay(rounds, p1Score, p2Score, winner) → Unity
    cinematic
  • Unity sends replayComplete → KicksActivity shows score line

[Forfeit / Timeout]
  • Each MatchManager.waitFor* helper has a timeout default
    (DEFAULT_OPPONENT_WAIT_MS). On timeout the state machine goes to
    Failed(prev, e) — user retries or backs out. claimTimeout circuit
    + payout flow not yet wired in the UI (covered by the contract
    but not surfaced in the matchmaking screens).
```

### What's NOT in the IA yet

- **Pause / mid-match exit** — Unity pause button hard-kills the process
  (workaround for shared-process ANR); user relaunches from launcher.
  Proper polish item, see PLAN Phase 5.
- **Sudden death loop** — contract supports SD; orchestrator hand-off
  not yet wired into the UI flow. After regulation resolves tied, the
  state ends at Resolved without auto-routing into SD_COMMITTING.
- **Result screen + leaderboard** — PLAN Phase 4 step "Results screen +
  leaderboard query" still pending.
- **QR scanner** — JoinMatchScreen accepts hex paste / deep link only.
  Google Code Scanner is PLAN Phase 5 polish.

### State polling

While waiting for opponent actions, the Kotlin layer subscribes to the
contract state via the indexer (`MatchManager.awaitContractState` →
`StatePoller`, 3s tick). When the opponent's `committed`/`revealed`
flags change → the suspending `waitFor*` helper returns and the state
machine advances. The poller is started lazily inside the wait window
and torn down on return — no background polling between waits.

### Per-role choice UI

**Decided:** the keep prompt is reframed to match the contract's
coordinate convention. The player picks a goal corner in both roles:

| Role | Banner copy | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Shoot | `YOU SHOOT — pick where to kick` | "I'm kicking to *that* corner" |
| Keep | `YOU KEEP — predict where they'll kick` | "I think they'll aim *that* corner" |

Same L/C/R buttons in both roles, same shooter-perspective coordinate
space, same committed value semantics. The keeper's body lean in the
replay is derived from this committed value, not chosen separately —
see `Keeper.cs:Dive` for the mirror animation logic.

Considered and deferred:
- **Visual goal diagram** above the buttons — would eliminate the
  "whose left is left" ambiguity by rendering the target zones. Polish
  item, one PNG/SVG asset + a layout pass. Worth doing pre-launch.
- **Per-role 3D camera + interaction** — shoot rounds show goal from
  behind the ball, keep rounds show shooter from inside the goal,
  player taps regions of the 3D scene. Substantial Unity work,
  post-launch.

The decision locks in: **contract stays shooter-coord, presentation
changes only.**

## 5. Unity ↔ Kotlin bridge

UaaL renders Unity full-screen as an Android Activity. Communication via `UnitySendMessage` (Kotlin → Unity) and `AndroidJavaObject` callbacks (Unity → Kotlin).

## 6. Edge cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Both players pick identical directions all 5 rounds | Score 0-0 → sudden death |
| Both miss all 5 in sudden death | Non-decisive → another SD batch |
| Player commits then closes app | Timeout → opponent claims forfeit |
| Both players timeout (neither commits) | Both can reclaim their stake |
| Player tries to reveal wrong preimage | Circuit rejects (commitment mismatch) |
| Player submits invalid direction (>2) | `validDirection()` check fails in circuit |
| Network disconnect during replay | On-chain result unchanged, replay is cosmetic |
| Player opens app after match resolved | Sees result screen, can claim payout |
| 10+ sudden death batches (extreme tie) | Protocol supports infinite batches. Practically impossible (3^5 = 243 combinations). |
